Physical deployment
===================

Plumbing 
--------
Two or three tubes are setup so the inlets are approximately plumb and spread
out several heights, typically ~0.5m, ~1.5m and ~2.5m. The tubes are attached 
to specific ports of a pair of three-way valves; in a two-tube configuration, 
only one 3-way valve is used.

Slow-response trace gas analyzer inputs
---------------------------------------
The gradient system has (2) differential analog input (0-5V) terminals 
reserved for input from a slow-response trace gas analyzer. 

Thermistor inputs
-----------------
A set of aspirated thermistors is used to measure the gradient of temperature.
When combined with eddy-covariance measurements of sensible heat flux, an 
eddy diffusivity constant (k) may be estimated.

Closed-path CO2/H2O analyzer inputs
-----------------------------------
A closed-path CO2/H2O analyzer is plumbed in parallel with the slow-response
trace gas analyzer so that a gradient of CO2 concentrations is measured. When
coupled with eddy-covariance measurements of CO2 flux, an eddy diffusivity 
constant (k) may be estimated.

Datalogger program
==================

Upon receiving power, the datalogger will turn on and compile the program. Once
running the user can make changes to settings and monitor measurements. 

Sensor settings
---------------

Thermistors
```````````
The thermistors may be set in three different 'modes' of operation: normal,
calibrating or disabled. When turned on, the default mode is "normal" but the
mode may be changed by navigating the menu 'Sensor setup' > 'Thermistors' >
'Set mode'. When in calibration mode, the thermistor data is recorded to a
separate data table; it is not included in generated statistics. When disabled,
thermistor data is not saved in the statistics or calibration tables.
Regardless of mode, the thermistor data is saved in the time-series table. A 
pair of boolean values in the time-series table indicates the operating mode
of the thermistors at a given time.


Data products
-------------

gradient_tsdata
```````````````
Table with 1Hz measurement values

gradient_stats
``````````````
Table with statistics computed for a given interval. Default interval = 30min

tmpr_cal
````````
Table with avg/stdev of thermistors. Output interval is 1min (default). Because
of how the calibration table is triggered, the first interval only may be of
partial length; all other intervals will represent data collected over the 
entire interval.
